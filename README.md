# JillTuckerNursingServices
Website for JTNS. Built the site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The development code was written in ES2015, SCSS, JQuery, Babel, Webpack and NodeJS. I wrote the template with ES2015 pulling content from JSON files which the client can update. I used Webpack and Babel to transpile the ES6 codes to ES5. The animation is done using GSAP engine.
